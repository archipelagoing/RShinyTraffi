For Stage 1 of our project, we created a shared Git repository and divided our group into two teams: Frontend and Backend. The Backend team is responsible for data cleaning and transformation, while the Frontend team uses the Backend components to visually develop the RShiny app. Currently, the app displays the distribution of traffic violations, by age, gender, and type of violation. In the sidebar panel, the app allows users to zoom into specific violations and filter by age and gender. Filtering allows users to see the total number of traffic violation tickets acquired by a certain gender and age group. Additionally, there is a button that redirects users to a pop that will provide an analysis and description of the project. Our next steps include refining the RShiny app and potentially incorporating another data set to gain additional insights into NYC traffic violations.
