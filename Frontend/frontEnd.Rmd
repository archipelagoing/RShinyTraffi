Our analysis of NYC traffic violations from 2020 to 2023 shows interesting trends and insights into road safety and enforcement patterns. Across all demographics within the dataset, the five most common traffic violations include: speed in zone, uninspected motor vehicle, speed over 55 zone, weaving (moved from lane unsafely), and failing to stop at stop sign. Looking at gender, we were able to find that across all years, males consistently received the most violations, which could reflect a combination of their driving patterns and enforcement practices that predominantly target males. Looking at age groups, the age group 26-35 had the most traffic violations overall. On the other hand, older drivers (76-85) had consistently low violation rates, which reflects either safer driving habits, less driving activity, or less focus from enforcement. Additionally, speeding violations were particularly higher among younger drivers (16-25 and 26-35), which might suggest that these age groups have riskier driving behaviors. Another interesting trend we found is that there was a high number of uninspected motor vehicle violations (approximately 655) which might indicate that there could be a widespread lack of awareness about inspection requirements. Now looking at yearly trends, traffic violations were lowest in 2021, which is most likely due to reduced driving activity and change in enforcement priorities during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, by 2023, violations peaked, with noticeable increases in younger age groups. This increase may possibly be driven by increased post-pandemic driving activity or improved enforcement efforts. The data suggests that there could be potential disparities in enforcement or targeting, as some demographics may see higher violation rates. To address these potential disparities, there should be increased awareness about inspection requirements and the risk of partaking in poor driving behaviors. This data may also help in enforcement strategies by shifting the focus on the top 5 traffic violations. Overall, analyzing this data is the first step to reducing violations, improving road safety, and better traffic enforcement in New York City.
